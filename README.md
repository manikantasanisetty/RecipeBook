# RecipeBook App

## Summary
This is a recipe book app that fetches and displays recipes from an API. Users can refresh the list and view recipes by cuisine and name.

## Focus Areas
- Swift Concurrency for async operations.
- Efficient network usage with custom image caching.
- User-friendly error handling and empty state UI.

## Time Spent
~4 hours

## Trade-offs and Decisions
- Opted for a basic list UI to meet the single-screen requirement.
- Focused on testing core logic, omitting UI tests due to time constraints.

## Weakest Part of the Project
The UI lacks advanced animations or custom styling due to time prioritization on core functionality.

## Additional Information
The app can handle errors gracefully and efficiently cache images to reduce bandwidth usage.
